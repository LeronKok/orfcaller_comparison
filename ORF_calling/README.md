# ORF_calling

The commands in `orf_calling.sh` can be used to recreate the ORF prediction results. This file contains all commands for the called tools. In short, first some indexes/reference files were created for bowtie2, STAR, ORFquant, PRICE and Ribotricer. Quality control and trimming of the reads was done using Trim Galore, followed by contaminant removal with bowtie2 and mapping by STAR. Then ORFquant, PRICE, Ribo-TISH and Ribotricer were used for the ORF calling. 

- ORFquant was used as R-package, the sessioninfo is available in `orfquant_sessioninfo.txt`.
- PRICE was installed as part of the gedi package.
- Ribo-TISH was installed in a conda environment. The installed packages are available in `conda_ribotish.txt`
- Ribotricer was installed in a conda environment. The installed packages are available in `conda_ribotricer.txt`

The file `prc_process_bedgraph.py` is a python3 script used to localize the activity values/P-sites generated by PRICe to the first nucleotide of the codon, such that those are comparable to the output from ORFquant and can be used in IGV.

# ORF_comparison

The script `orf_callers_comparison.Rmd` can be used to recreate the comparisons of the ORF callers by number of ORFs detected, ORF lengths and ORF categories. The sessioninfo associated with this R script is stored in `comparison_sessioninfo.txt`.

Before usage, the file path strings and file path vectors under the heading `# Define directories, files and colors` have to be initialized as documented. Afterwards, consecutive execution of all code blocks should recreate the analyses. Please note that for PRICE, it is expected that the .tsv output file is present in the same directory as the .cit.bed output file.

The script `orf_visualization.Rmd` can be used to recreate the visualizations of the ORFs detected on SPTBN1 and TUG1 in figure 3, panels D and E of the associated paper. The sessioninfo associated with this R script is stored in `visualization_sessioninfo.txt`.

Before usage, the file path strings and file path vectors under the heading `# Define global variables` have to be initialized as documented. Note that the file `orfs_separate.RData` is generated by the script `orf_callers_comparison.Rmd`, and as such that the given save path should be the same for both scripts. Consecutive execution of all code blocks should recreate the ORF visualizations.
